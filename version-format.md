# Version Formatting  
The version numbers are formatted like this:  
v[main-version].[variation-version]  
## The main version
If the main version is 0 the specification has not yet been completed.  
1 means it has been completed and 2 or higher means there were several  
overworks. Each overwork adds 1 to the main version.  
## The variation version
If the variation version is 0 it means it's the first version of the  
current main version. Every variation version after that adds some  
minor changes.  
## The changelogs
