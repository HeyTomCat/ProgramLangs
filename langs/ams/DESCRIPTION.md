## AMS
AMS, which is short for "Advanced Minimalistic aSsembly", is a register-based programming language.  
Being syntactically inspired by assembly it is'nt very practical to use in real applications and it isn't easy to read. Even I, the creator of AMS, consider AMS as a kind of esoteric programming language.  
The current compiler is programmed in [RUST-LANG](https://rust-lang.org) and can be found in [/src](https://github.com/HeyTomCat/ProgramLangs/blob/main/langs/src). Compiled versions aren't availabe, meaning you'll have to compile the compiler yourself for your own system.  
It would be greatly appreciated, if you, the reader, write your own implementation of AMS based on 
the given [SPECIFICATION](https://github.com/HeyTomCat/ProgramLangs/blob/main/langs/ams/spec.md) or write your own versions or dialects of the language.
