## AMS
AMS, which is short for "Advanced Minimalistic aSsembly", is a register-based programming language.  
Being syntactically inspired by assembly it is'nt easy to read, but it also isn't meant to be used for programming real applications and is meant more as an esoteric programming language.  
It would be appreciated, if you, the reader, write your own implementation of AMS based on the SPECIFICATION[] or write your own versions or dialects of the language.
