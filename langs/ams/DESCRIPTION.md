## AMS
AMS, which is short for "Advanced Minimalistic aSsembly", is a register-based programming language.  
Being syntactically inspired by assembly it is'nt easy to read, but it also isn't meant to be used 
for programming real applications and is meant more as an esoteric programming language.  
It would be greatly appreciated, if you, the reader, write your own implementation of AMS based on 
the given [SPECIFICATION](https://github.com/HeyTomCat/ProgramLangs/blob/main/langs/ams/spec.md) or write your own versions or dialects of the language.
