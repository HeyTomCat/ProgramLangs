## INTRODUCTION
AMS, which is short for "advanced minimalistic assembly", is an 8-bit register-based programming language with an assembly-inspired syntax.  
It is compiled to a special bytecode before being executed by a runtime environment. Alternatively it can be compiled to native machine code or assembly.  
## DATA STORAGE

AMS uses a total of 8 registers, which are the only directly accessible type of data storage. Most of them have different purposes which are listed in the following table:  
|Register name|Register|Purpose|
