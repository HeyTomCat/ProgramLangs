## General Information
The "advanced minimalistic assembly", or short AMA, is a programming language with an assembly-like syntax. Saved in .AMA files, programs should usually be "assembled" to an .XAP (eXecutable Assembled Program) file and then be executed by a runtime environment. The language is designed to be light-weight and to have minimalistic instructions.
