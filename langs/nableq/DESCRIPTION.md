# Nableq
Nableq is an assembly-like language designed to be as minimalistic as possible while still being [turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) being able to run on a special [OISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-instruction_set_computer). This language was highly inspired by [SUBLEQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-instruction_set_computer#Subtract_and_branch_if_less_than_or_equal_to_zero), just made more minimalistic. But please don't take this language seriously, it should definitly be classified as an [esolang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language). You're free to write your own implementations or dialects of Nableq, maybe based on the [specification](https://github.com/HeyTomCat/ProgramLangs/blob/main/langs/nableq/spec.md). To learn how to code in Nableq read the [TUTORIAL](https://github.com/HeyTomCat/ProgramLangs/blob/main/langs/nableq/tutorial.md).
