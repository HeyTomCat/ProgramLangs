specifications/conventions for files, specification of commands and bit management,  
specification of external commands, specifications of code formatting, specialties.  
## File specifications/conventions  
It should bes saved as an .malx file. This can be made by creating (conventionally) an ASCII .txt file.  
After programming through some sort of text editor the file can be renamed to an .malx file.  
## Specifications for commands and byte management  
As MALX will first be transpiled to "compiled minimalistic assembly language extended", or short CMALX,  
before being executed (see SPECIALTIES), that intermediate language (CMALX) will need bit management  
for how commands are saved.
