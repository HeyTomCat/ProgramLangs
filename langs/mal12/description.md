# MAL12
The "minimalistc assembly language 12 bit", short MAL12 isn't actually an assembly language.  
This programming language is programmed in python, supports 8 commands(see mal12_cmd.txt for more info),  
and operates on 12-bit-integers.  
  
# STATUS: Incomplete  
# FUTURE: Probably no further work
